# My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning notes repository! Here, I'll be documenting everything I learn as I dive into different technologies, tools, and frameworks. This will serve as my reference guide as I go along, and a place to track what Iâ€™ve accomplished.

### What i will be learning

- Building components
- Rendering markup with jsx
- Managing state
- Passing input via props
- Debugging React apps

#### Creating a ListGroup Component

- install bootstrap to give our application a modern look and feel
- Bootstrap is a common css library
- In my project i used npm to install bootstrap@5.2.3
- used this line {import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-grid.css";} to import it to main.tsx
- It is a common and important practice to have a component folder for all components
